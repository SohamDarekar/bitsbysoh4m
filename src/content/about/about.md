# Hey, I'm Soham ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore IT student based in Mumbai, India, currently learning, building, and growing one week at a time.

This blog is where I document the journey: not just the big milestones but also the small wins, experiments, stumbles, and reflections along the way. Whether itâ€™s a project Iâ€™m working on, a lesson that stuck with me, or just something that made my week better, youâ€™ll find it here.

Itâ€™s also my little memory capsule, a place to look back on how far Iâ€™ve come, remind myself of what Iâ€™ve learned, and celebrate progress, no matter how small.

Iâ€™m deeply curious about technology and how it can be used to solve real problems. I enjoy full-stack web development, dabble in AI and machine learning, and love writing things down to understand them better and help others do the same. But more than anything, Iâ€™m focused on becoming a little better every day: in code, in life, and in mindset.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Weekly snapshots from my learning and life journey  
- Honest reflections, personal growth updates, and experiments Iâ€™m trying  
- My current favorites (books, tools, workouts, podcasts, and random inspiration)  
- Projects Iâ€™m working on and what theyâ€™re teaching me  

Think of this blog as an open journal: a mix of tech, thoughts, and the things that keep me going. Feel free to explore, connect, or just say hi!

## A Little More About Me

Right now, Iâ€™m:
- Exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, one concept at a time  
- Trying to better my physical and mental health through small, consistent habits   

Thanks for dropping by. Iâ€™m really glad youâ€™re here!
