# My LASIK Surgery Experience (SMILE Procedure)

After a bunch of diagnostic tests, my doctor recommended something called **SmartSight** ‚Äî a newer, less invasive LASIK technique known as **SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction)**. Compared to traditional LASIK, it‚Äôs supposed to be safer, gentler, and better for long-term corneal stability.

## What Even *Is* SMILE?

So, unlike traditional LASIK that involves slicing a flap in your eye (ewww), SMILE just creates a tiny lenticule (a disc-shaped piece of tissue) that‚Äôs pulled out through a small side cut. No flap, less drama.

## The Actual Surgery

The whole thing took maybe **15 minutes** and, surprisingly, was **completely painless**. The weirdest part? The metal clips used to keep my eyes open ‚Äî uncomfortable, but not unbearable. Right after the surgery, my vision was crazy blurry for about half an hour. It got a little better as the day went on but stayed foggy till the next day.

Oh, and the doctor gave me **six different eye drops** to put in my eyes on a strict schedule. Six. It‚Äôs like I had a mini pharmacy in my hand every few hours.

## Recovery Rules I Followed

- **Zero screen time** for 4 whole days (yes, it was painful ‚Äî spiritually, not physically)  
- Wore my **protective glasses** 24/7, even while sleeping  
- No workouts, no swimming, and definitely no head baths for at least 8 days  

## Vision Progress

My eyesight is already a lot better than before, though it‚Äôs still a tiny bit blurry. The doctor said it could take up to a **month** to stabilize, but from what I‚Äôve read on Reddit ([r/Lasik](https://www.reddit.com/r/lasik/) and [r/Lasiksupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lasiksupport/)), it‚Äôs more like **6 to 8 months** for full healing. So I‚Äôm just playing the long game.

## üéß Recommended Eye Podcasts  

These really helped me prep mentally and understand what was going on with my eyes ‚Äî especially when I couldn‚Äôt stare at screens for days.

# Weekly Reflections  
***

## This Week, I'm Grateful For
- A smooth LASIK surgery and no complications üôè  
- Spotify podcasts that made the no-screen life bearable  
- Audiobooks ‚Äî lifesavers during eye rest  
- Somehow keeping my screen time under 30 minutes daily  

## This Week, I Learned
- Long-term contact lens use can actually mess up your eyes  
- How insanely underrated **eye hygiene** is  
- That **boredom is a skill** ‚Äî sitting still without reaching for a screen is weirdly empowering  
- Deep work > shallow scrolling. Every time.  

## This Week, What's Been on My Mind
- When should I finally launch and go live with this blog?  
- How soon can I jump back into ‚Äúproductive‚Äù mode without rushing the healing process?  
- Am I slowly turning into one of those bio-hacking guys?

## A Personal Win I'm Super Proud Of  
Okay so, I finally **brought an old bricked phone back to life** after trying literally a million times over the past few months. It finally booted up ‚Äî and the moment it did, I swear I had goosebumps. There's just something magical about fixing tech on your own. It reminded me why I love doing this stuff.

Seriously, that feeling of ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù when you resurrect dead tech? Out of this world. It made me feel like ‚Äî yeah, I‚Äôm going to be a good computer engineer someday.

Oh, and once it booted? Of course, I **rooted it again**. üòõ

## My Favorite Song This Week  
Been hooked on this Drake track ‚Äî the melodies, the flow‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been running laps in my head.

## My Favorite Podcast Episode This Week  
Dr. Huberman‚Äôs deep dive on **alcohol and the brain** really hit home. It‚Äôs science-heavy, but super easy to follow. Highly recommend giving it a listen.

## My Favorite Content This Week  
üé§ Shane Gillis‚Äô **Beautiful Dogs** stand-up special on Netflix.  
Exactly the kind of ridiculous, unfiltered humor I needed during recovery. Just pure fun.

## My Favorite Tech This Week  
Shoutout to **Amazon Alexa** ‚Äî the real MVP while I was screenless. Just had to say ‚Äúplay music‚Äù and boom, vibes. Though honestly‚Ä¶ she still doesn‚Äôt understand me half the time and totally fumbles podcasts. Still, pretty clutch for music.
