# Weekly Reflections

---

## This Week, I'm Grateful For

- A short but sweet family getaway to a nice resort for my cousin brother‚Äôs birthday. Good food, good vibes, and some quality time with people I‚Äôve grown up with.

- Somehow got a new pair of wired boAt earphones for free. All I had to do was leave a review on Amazon (kinda makes sense now how they rack up so many 5-stars üíÄ). Wired just feels safer to me, even though science keeps saying wireless doesn‚Äôt harm you, I don‚Äôt fully buy it. Something about Bluetooth in my ears all day just feels off.

- Picked up a couple of new sweatshirts for college. Nothing fancy, but there‚Äôs something about fresh clothes that resets your mood.

- Had a slow, chill week before college starts again. Loved just existing without the pressure to be ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time. Honestly, I needed that.

## This Week, I Learned

- That I _absolutely cannot_ install a custom ROM on my second device, the ever-so-cooperative Realme 7. Tried everything. Bricked it so many times I‚Äôve lost count. Recovery swaps, bootloader wizardry, tech voodoo, nothing worked. To make it better, the power button is completely fucked. I have to stab it with a pen like I‚Äôm performing surgery just to turn it on. Love that for me.

---

## This Week, I Struggled With

- Learning? Yeah, didn‚Äôt happen. I was out of town without my laptop, so I just revisited old stuff and pretended it counted.

- My workout routine? Absolutely fell off a cliff. Blaming it on travel even though I probably could‚Äôve done a push-up or two. But alas, I did not.

---

## This Week's Highlight

- There‚Äôs something genuinely healing about spending time with family and cousins who are around your age. It hits different. Like a quiet reset for the soul. We went on a 3-day resort trip tucked inside this gorgeous forest retreat. The place had everything ‚Äî a bird-sighting station, riverside camping spots, and more games than I could keep up with. Cricket was fun. Archery? Yeah... turns out I‚Äôm absolute ass at that. But honestly, the whole trip helped me wind down properly before college kicks back into chaos mode.

- Had a really nice lunch with Mom and Dad today for Father's Day. It wasn‚Äôt anything fancy, but it felt warm and real. Just sitting, eating, and talking with them. I‚Äôve started appreciating those small moments more lately. Feels good to bond with them not just as their kid, but as a person they actually vibe with.

## This Week‚Äôs Favorite Tech Tools

- <a href="https://forum.mobilism.me/" target="_blank"><b>Mobilism</b></a> ‚Äì A goldmine for modded apps and games. Think of it as a Play Store for the slightly rebellious. Just make sure you‚Äôre only downloading from trusted uploaders, it‚Äôs easy to get carried away and end up with shady APKs if you‚Äôre not careful.

- <a href="https://vanced.to/" target="_blank"><b>Vanced.to</b></a> ‚Äì A solid hub for modded app lovers. From YouTube Vanced to surprise finds like Google News mods (yes, seriously üíÄ), this site has some gems if you‚Äôre willing to dig around a bit.

## This Week's Favorite Podcast

- Didn‚Äôt really listen to any podcasts this week. Was either offline, out of town, or just not in the mood to have someone talk in my ear for an hour straight. Will probably get back to it next week when things settle down a bit.

## This Week's Favorite Song

- This one‚Äôs been on repeat all week. The beat, the vibe, that guitar solo, the _Rick Ross verse_ ‚Äî it all hits so smooth. Probably stumbled back onto it because of the memes, but stayed for the mood. Definitely one of Ye‚Äôs most underrated tracks if you ask me.

## This Week‚Äôs Favorite Piece of Content

<div class="video-container">

  .video-container {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%; 
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    max-width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;

</style>

- This one really stuck with me. The video dives into the idea that all of us have the innate power to manifest, because we‚Äôre literally a part of the _Brahmn_ ‚Äî the supreme consciousness. It breaks down how even Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe, didn‚Äôt just snap his fingers and build everything. He _meditated_ and _visualized_ the entire living world for over 1000 celestial years before it came into being. That puts a whole new spin on the ‚Äúvisualize your goals‚Äù advice we keep hearing

- Loved the way it mixed ancient philosophy with this super raw and nostalgic aesthetic, glitchy visuals, grainy cuts, lo-fi edits. Felt like watching spiritual wisdom meet vaporwave. Definitely not your average manifestation content.

## Next Week, I‚Äôm Focused On‚Ä¶

- Getting my routine back on track: workouts, sleep, studying, all of it. I‚Äôve been floating around in vacation mode long enough, and college is about to punch me in the face if I don‚Äôt shape up.
- Prepping for sophomore year: new subjects, new chaos, and hopefully a slightly more put-together version of me. Need to hit the ground running before things spiral.
- Getting back into my AI/ML learning grind. I‚Äôve lost a bit of momentum lately, so next week‚Äôs about picking up where I left off ‚Äî brushing up on fundamentals, playing with small projects, and maybe not procrastinating every tutorial I bookmark.
- Oh, and reviving my reading habit. Even a couple of focused chapters would be a win at this point.

## Final Thoughts

- This week felt like a breather, the calm before the storm. Between the resort trip, spending time with family, and not touching my laptop for days, I definitely disconnected (maybe a bit too much). But honestly, I think I needed it. Sometimes doing ‚Äúnothing productive‚Äù is actually productive, just not in the LinkedIn kind of way.

- Now that college is creeping back in, it‚Äôs time to shift gears. I‚Äôm trying to move into next week with more structure, less chaos, and a bit more momentum ‚Äî academically, physically, and mentally. Not expecting a perfect comeback, but if I can stack a few wins, I‚Äôll call it progress. Let‚Äôs see how long that energy lasts.
