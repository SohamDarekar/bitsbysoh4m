# Weekly Reflections

---

## This Week's Highlight Was

- Realizing this blog might be my *last* web dev project for a while. Iâ€™m seriously thinking of locking in and fully switching to AI/ML. Honestly? I fucking *hate* spending hours aligning divs or picking a color palette. I want to do work that *matters*, stuff that needs deep thought, analysis, and decision-making.  
I've previously tried diving into AI/ML â€” and absolutely fucking *loved* it. This is gonna be my focus for the coming days, weeks, or even months.

---

## This Week, I Learned

- How to set up your own newsletter service (GitHub Copilot â€” the fucking GOAT helped big time).
- How important digital minimalism is for deep, meaningful work in todayâ€™s economy.
- The real value of FOSS (Free & Open Source Software) â€” honestly, itâ€™s more useful than most paid services out there.

---

## This Week, I'm Grateful For

- Starting my own newsletter service and backend without relying on major companies.
- Setting up Umami â€” an open-source analytics tool â€” for my blog.
- A speedy recovery from LASIK surgery.
- Getting my average screen time on my phone down to under 4 hours a day (used to be 8+ hours lol).

---

## This Week, Whatâ€™s Been On My Mind

- That Iâ€™ll finally be able to resume fitness training and gym next week. So I went ahead and optimized my workout plan and built a diet I can *actually* stick to.
- My mindâ€™s been mostly occupied with how I can improve this blog further. Iâ€™ve made a few changes â€” more are on the way.
- Iâ€™m finally starting my AI/ML journey. Spent hours researching, watching videos, and building a roadmap with legit resources.

## This Week, I Struggled With

- Getting sucked back into doomscrolling after lunch â€” even with app limits in place.
- Nighttime halos and starbursts post-LASIK are still annoying (though recovery is going well overall).
- Deciding *where* to start with AI/ML. Thereâ€™s so much noise, and I want signal.

---

## This Weekâ€™s Mindset Shift

I always thought building websites was a form of creative self-expression. But this week, it felt like I was just rearranging Legos I didnâ€™t care about. AI/ML, on the other hand, feels like Iâ€™m finally solving puzzles that matter. Feels like Iâ€™m thinking again not just designing for dopamine.

---
## Tools Iâ€™m Using This Week

- **Umami Analytics** â€” slick, minimal, fast. Goodbye Google Analytics.
- **GitHub Copilot** â€” dumb sometimes, but clutch when it works.

---

## This Week, My Favorite Piece of Tech Is

- GitHub Copilot. The GOAT.  
  Helped me set up Umami Analytics and my newsletter system. Itâ€™s kinda dumb sometimes, but when it works, it *really* works.

---

## This Week, My Favorite Quote from a Book Is

From *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport (about 15% in so far) â€” and it's already hitting hard. Newport draws on Henry David Thoreauâ€™s philosophy of New Economics to argue just how little we truly get in return for the attention we pour into social media. It doesnâ€™t meet any of our fundamental needs â€” not food, clothing, or shelter â€” yet we give it hours of our lives. The book is making me seriously reconsider how I spend my time. Might actually start applying some of this in real life.

---

## This Week, I Learned This Fun Fact

- You *literally* start liking your surroundings â€” and people â€” more just because you consumed caffeine near them. Mind. Fucking. Blown.

---

## This Week, My Favorite Podcast Episode Is

- I was *shook* to learn that caffeine is a reinforcing agent â€” meaning whenever you have coffee (or any caffeinated drink), you start liking the *environment* you consume it in. Have coffee in the same mug often? Youâ€™ll end up liking that mug more. Same thing applies to people, drink caffeine around someone often, and your brain starts liking that person a bit more.

## This Week, My Favorite Song Is

- I donâ€™t agree with Yeâ€™s current stances at all ðŸ’€, but I love *The College Dropout*. Miss the old Ye!

## Next Week, I'm Focused Onâ€¦

- Taking my first real steps into AI/ML, starting from scratch with Python.
- Building a consistent gym + diet routine post-LASIK.
- Finishing *Digital Minimalism* and implementing some of its advice IRL.

## Final Thought

This week felt like I shut one door and opened a window to something way more exciting. Letâ€™s see what happens when I *actually* go all in.
