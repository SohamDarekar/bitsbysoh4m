title: " Week 5: Rain, Recovery & a Return to Flow "
description: "A week that started in bed with food poisoning ended in code, cousins, and quiet wins. From ditching drenched train rides to building a custom certificate generator for college, this was the breather I didnâ€™t know I needed â€” a reset before the real grind begins."

# Weekly Reflections

---

## Quick Note:
- Missed last weekâ€™s blog? Yeah, me too. Turns out, getting diagnosed with horrible food poisoning will do that to you. It sucked every ounce of energy from my body and left me basically glued to my bed, binge-watching ceiling fan rotations. Not the comeback I had in mind, but hey, I survived.

- Also, just a heads upâ€”this blog is all about this weekâ€™s experiences, not the one before that. Last week was a blur, and honestly, youâ€™re not missing much unless youâ€™re into tales of electrolyte drinks and endless naps.

## This Week, Iâ€™m Grateful For

- Finally taking a car to college instead of braving Mumbai's local trains during the monsoon madness. Dry clothes and sanity intact, that's a major win.
- Creating a new certificate generator for my college's IEEE student branch. Iâ€™ll dive into this project later in the blog.
- My cousins. Got to hang out with them this weekend, shared a great dinner, and made countless memories and laughs.
- Actually recovering from that food poisoning saga. Never been so grateful for plain old dal-chawal.
- Playing football after literally a year. Spoiler: I've lost all my skills ðŸ˜­, but it felt awesome to be back on the field.

## This Week, I Learned
- Dived a bit more into the workings of an operating system (part of my syllabus). Lowkey, I'm actually enjoying that subject.
- Got hands-on with loops, iterations, and conditional statements in Python. 
- On a lighter note, I also learned that Call of Dut: Modern Warfare 2019 has finally been cracked after years.

## This Week, I Struggled With

- Sticking to my diet and workout routine was basically impossible thanks to the food poisoning. Recovery mode meant comfort food and zero motivation to exercise.
- I also struggled with really locking in and focusing on Python. Kept getting distracted and couldnâ€™t build the momentum I wanted.

## This Weekâ€™s Highlight

- The biggest win this week? I finally built a certificate generator for my collegeâ€™s IEEE student branch (shoutout to the tech team life). Weâ€™ve got a new event coming up for WIE Day, and if youâ€™ve ever helped out with these, you know the struggle: making individual certificates for every single participant is just pain. It takes forever and honestly, nobody wants to sit and do that.

- So I decided to make life easier for everyone. I built a certificate generator where students just enter their name and a verification code or roll number, and the system spits out their certificate using a template I set up in the backend. Weâ€™ll have the legit attendee list stored in a JSON file, so only actual participants can generate their certificates. No randoms sneaking in.

- The trickiest part? Getting the certificate template to look exactly how we wanted. I had to manually adjust the x and y positions for the text, which was way more tedious than I expected. But now that itâ€™s done, Iâ€™m honestly pretty proud of it. Feels good to build something thatâ€™ll save everyone a bunch of time and effort.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Tech Tool

- Been using an Android markdown editor app to write this blog from my phone since my laptopâ€™s out of reach right now lol. Super handy and does the job perfectly.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Podcast

- Didnâ€™t really binge any specific episode, but I stumbled on this podcast called The Stories of Mahabharata on Spotify. Currently on episode 35 and honestly, itâ€™s a vibe. Always wanted to get into mythologies and now I finally get what all the hypeâ€™s about. Super fun way to actually understand the stories for once.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Song

- Farebi by Chaardiwari has been my go-to track all week. I had it playing on aux in the car every time I was out commuting, just letting it run on repeat. Honestly, I can't get enough of his music. He was one of my top artists on Spotify Wrapped last year, and for good reason. There's just something about his vibe that makes every drive feel cinematic.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Piece of Content

- Honestly, I didn't really consume any significant piece of content this week. I was mostly caught up working on my projects, studying, or just deep in coding mode. Sometimes the grind takes over and thereâ€™s barely any time left to just sit back and watch something.

---

## Next Week, Iâ€™m Focused Onâ€¦
- Diving more into Python and getting hands-on with new stuff
- Starting to study math more seriously, not just skimming through notes
- Actually being consistent with my diet and workout, no more skipping or making excuses

---

## Final Thoughts

- This week felt like a real reset after the chaos of being sick and stuck in bed. Getting back to college, building something useful, and just spending time with people I care about made things feel normal again. Iâ€™m not at a hundred percent with my routines yet, but at least Iâ€™m moving in the right direction. The goal for next week is simple: keep up the momentum, stay curious, and not let small setbacks throw me off. Progress over perfection, always.
