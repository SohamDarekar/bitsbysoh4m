# Weekly Reflections

---

## This Week, I Learned 

- Got the hang of Python basics â€” syntax, data types, and core data structures finally feel familiar.
- Took a deeper look at how Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab actually function. Turns out I was just scratching the surface before.
- Started refining my workout routine â€” trying to build something that balances cardio, hypertrophy, strength training, and athletic performance. Itâ€™s a lot to juggle, but Iâ€™m enjoying the process.

## This Week, I'm Grateful For

- **Caffeine** â€” absolute MVP this week. Iâ€™ve been sleep-deprived and this beautiful molecule kept me moving.
- **Night-mode & blue-light filters** â€” helped regulate my sleep better. Shoutout to [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com) if youâ€™re on Windows.
- **Huberman Lab** â€” still obsessed. Science + practical insights? Iâ€™m in. If youâ€™ve been reading my blogs, you already knew this was coming ðŸ˜›
- **Consistency with workouts** â€” proud of myself for not skipping a single day. It really shifted the tone of my whole week.

## This Week, I Struggled With

- Mental health wasnâ€™t great this week. Felt weirdly melancholic and low without any clear reason.
- Went for my 15-day post-LASIK check-up â€” doctor said my recoveryâ€™s been slow, and my eyesight still hasnâ€™t fully bounced back. Trying to stay patient.
- Doom-scrolling hit hard. Especially ironic considering I talked about implementing *Digital Minimalism* last week.
- Barely ate enough despite working out every day. Definitely felt the effects â€” low energy, less progress. Need to fix this next week.

## This Week's Highlight

- Stumbled upon the *perfect* course to kick off my AI/ML journey â€” and the best part? It was free (thanks to a site that shares Udemy coupons). The course is called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/10cD673@GV047eZI7qgsqVHUyUFO4EzsWTPrxNIIVTEHUewo7BwM1PNNNtyb2PU9GM3fOcPZdw==/" target="_blank">Data Science & AI Masters 2025 - From Python To Gen AI</a>, and itâ€™s been a game-changer so far. The instructor explains everything at just the right pace, no bloat, no filler â€” just solid learning.
- Iâ€™ve officially caught the AI/ML bug. Still learning the basics, but Iâ€™m genuinely loving it. Python makes things feel way smoother than what I was used to in college â€” intuitive, even fun. Canâ€™t believe I didnâ€™t start sooner.
- Canâ€™t wait to move beyond theory and start building actual ML projects soon. Feels like Iâ€™ve finally found something Iâ€™m *excited* to learn.

## This Week, Whatâ€™s Been On My Mind

- I came across a reel where someone built a really aesthetic and functional habit journal using a simple square-grid notebook. It had everything: daily habit tracking, a one-sentence highlight or memory from the day, sleep scores, timings, and more. Super minimalist but super effective.

- It got me thinking, I want to build something like that for myself. Not just to stay accountable, but to actually *see* how I grow over the months. Feels like a great way to connect the dots between mood, habits, and progress. Canâ€™t wait to get started.

- This weekâ€™s emotional lows made one thing clear â€” I need to be more intentional about caring for my mental health. Iâ€™m planning to implement small but consistent habits like gratitude journaling, meditation, and mindfulness. Nothing dramatic, just regular check-ins with myself to stay grounded and present.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Tech Tools

- <a href="https://real.discount/" target="_blank"><b>real.discount</b></a> â€” absolute goldmine for free Udemy courses. Found some insanely good content here. If you're trying to upskill on a budget, this site is a cheat code.
- <a href="https://justgetflux.com" target="_blank"><b>f.lux</b></a> â€” been a sleep-saver. It adjusts your screenâ€™s color temperature based on the time of day, making late-night screen time much easier on the eyes (and on your melatonin levels).

## This Week, My Favorite Podcast Episodes Are

Had two standout episodes this week, both totally different, both worth your time:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5LYlDlDu61KTirMe46YERi?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

- First up, Dr. Huberman (of course). This episode is packed with actionable insights on building a well-rounded workout routine â€” strength, endurance, aesthetics, itâ€™s all there.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2xKjdOoBlb1bEYh1yvnmGp?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

- The second one is wild, Raj Shamani interviews *Vijay Mallya*. The guy hadnâ€™t spoken publicly in almost a decade, and suddenly here he is telling his side of the story. Regardless of the controversies, the episode is gripping. I actually listened to the entire 4-hour podcast in one go, thatâ€™s how gripping it was. Iâ€™m not taking sides on the whole loan thing, not my place, but hearing about his upbringing and the way his dad raised him was honestly fascinating (at least from what he claims).

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Song

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3pjUyVbFmM96tYhSaKJwTt?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

- This oneâ€™s been on repeat, especially during the tougher moments. J. Cole is my GOAT â€” his music always hits different when life feels heavy. If you havenâ€™t listened to *4 Your Eyez Only* yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. You wonâ€™t regret it.

## This Weekâ€™s Favorite Piece of Content

- Fell in love with this video. The way the creator breaks down the teachings of the *Bhagavad Gita* is just next-level â€” deep, calming, and incredibly well-produced. The background music, the narration, the pacingâ€¦ everything just clicks.  
Also stumbled across this amazing comment while watching, and it genuinely added to the experience:

## Next Week, Iâ€™m Focused Onâ€¦

- Staying consistent with my Python & AI/ML learning â€” aiming to finish at least a couple of core modules from the course I started.
- Eating better. Genuinely want to fix my nutrition so I can complement my workouts and avoid feeling drained like I did this week.
- Being mindful of screen time. No more doom-scrolling â€” Iâ€™m setting strict limits and sticking to them.
- Journaling every night. Hoping it helps me get a better grip on my thoughts and improves my mental clarity.

## Final Thoughts

- This week was a mix of wins and challenges. I stayed consistent with working out and made real progress in my learning journey, but also hit some emotional lows and felt scattered at times. Still, showing up and reflecting feels like a win in itself. If youâ€™re reading this and going through your own highs and lows â€” just know itâ€™s okay. Progress isnâ€™t linear, and neither is life.

- Hereâ€™s to showing up again next week â€” with a little more discipline, a little more kindness, and a lot more intention.
